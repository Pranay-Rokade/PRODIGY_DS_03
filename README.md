# Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship - Task 03

## Overview
This repository contains the work completed for Task 03 of the Prodigy InfoTech Data Science internship. The objective of this task was to build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data.

## Task Description
### Task 03: Decision Tree Classifier
1. **Data Handlingg**:
   - Handled missing values.
   - Loaded and preprocessed the data.

2. **Building the Classifier**:
   - Created and trained a decision tree classifier using the preprocessed data.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this task is the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which can be downloaded from [Link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing).

## Repository Structure

- bank-full.csv: The dataset used for this Task.
- PRODIGY_DS_03: It is the ipynb file.
- README.md: This file, providing an overview of the task and how to use the repository.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Download the Bank Marketing dataset from the link above and place it in the appropriate directory.
3. Run the provided Python scripts to see the decision tree classifier.

## Getting Started

To get started with viewing the decision tree classifier:

1. Download the dataset from [Link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing).
2. Open the PRODIGY_DS_03.ipynb file for the decision tree classifier.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the use of decision tree classifiers to predict customer behavior based on demographic and behavioral data. The model provides insights that can help in targeted marketing strategies.
